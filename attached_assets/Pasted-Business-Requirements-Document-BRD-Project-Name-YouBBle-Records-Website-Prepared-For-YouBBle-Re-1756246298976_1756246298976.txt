1. Executive Summary
YouBBle Records is launching a bold, edgy, music-industry-inspired website that will serve as the central hub for its brand identity, programs, artist collaborations, and merchandising.
The platform will not only highlight the label’s music releases and social impact projects but also provide interactive engagement points for artists (demo submissions, collaborations) and fans (merch purchases, streaming links, podcast listening, event updates).
This document outlines the business requirements, design standards, functional needs, and success metrics for the project.

2. Business Objectives
The primary business objectives of the website are:
Brand Representation – Establish a modern, sleek, and edgy digital identity aligned with the music industry aesthetic.


Engagement – Offer fans, collaborators, and artists a place to connect, discover, and interact with YouBBle Records.


Monetization – Drive revenue streams through merch sales and service/kits purchases.


Collaboration & Discovery – Provide a platform for new talent to submit demos and engage with the label.


Social Responsibility – Showcase social impact initiatives and provide accessible resources (like the APK Kit download).


Community Building – Integrate podcasts, events, and projects to keep fans and artists continuously engaged.



3. Scope
In Scope
Development of a responsive, modern website with interactive elements.


Integration of merchandising capabilities (basic e-commerce with product catalog, pricing, and checkout).


Implementation of forms for program applications, demo submissions, and collaborations.


Streaming integration for previews (Spotify/Apple embeds).


Support for motion-based UI elements (scrolling banners, spinning logo, carousels).


Social media and event calendar integration.


Out of Scope
Large-scale ticket booking system (handled externally).


Advanced warehousing or fulfillment solutions for merch (will start with limited SKUs).


Full-fledged music streaming platform (site will redirect users to Spotify, Apple, etc.).
